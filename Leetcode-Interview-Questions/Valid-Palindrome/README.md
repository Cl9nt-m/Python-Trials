## Valid Palindrome 

### Question 

A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward.
alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string *s*, return *if it is a **palindrome**, or **false** otherwise.*

#### Implementation 

Convert all uppercase letters to lowercase letters.

Remove all non-alphanumeric characters.

Compare the modified string with its reverse to determine if it is a palindrome.
