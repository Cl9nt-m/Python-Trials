## Merge Sorted Array.

### Question.
 
You are given two integer arrays *num1* and *num2*, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two intergers
*m* and *n*, representing the number of elements in *num1* and *num2* respectively.


**Merge***num1* and *num2* into a single array sorted in **non-descreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be *stored* inside the array *num1*.
To accomodate this, *num1* has a length of *m + n*, where the first *m* elements denote the elements that 
should be merged, and the last *n* elements are set to *0* and should be ignored. *num1* and *num2* has a 
length of *n*.
