## Evaluate Division

### Question

You are given an array of variable pairs *equations* and an array of real numbers *values*, where *equations[i] = [Ai, Bi]* and *values[i]* represent the equation *Ai / Bi = values[i]*. Each *Ai* or *Bi* is a string that represents a single variable.

You are also given some *queries*, where *queries[j] = [Cj, Dj]* represents the *jth* query where you must find the answer for *Cj / Dj = ?.*

Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return *-1.0*.

Note: The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.

Note: The variables that do not occur in the list of equations are undefined, so the answer cannot be determined for them.

#### Implementation

It first constructs a directed graph where each variable is a node, and the edges represent the given equations and their corresponding values.

It defines a depth-first search (DFS) function to traverse the graph and calculate the result for each query. During the DFS, it recursively explores the graph, multiplying values along the path to find the result of the query.

If a path between variables doesn't exist in the graph, it returns -1.0. 

This approach ensures that we can efficiently evaluate queries, even when dealing with a largw number of equations and variables, and handles cases where variables are undefined or the equations form a complex network.
