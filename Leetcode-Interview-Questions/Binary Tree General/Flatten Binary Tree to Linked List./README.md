## Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List.

### Question

Given the *root* of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

- The linked list should use the sa,e *TreeNode* class where the *right* child pointer points to the next node in the list and the *left* child pointer is always *null*.

- The lined list should be in the same order as a **pre-order traversal** of the binsary tree.

#### Implementation
