Here is a brief documentation of each program. A detailed explaination of each.

### Body-Mass-Index:
    
    This is a tool used to assess a person's body weight in relation to their height.
    It is a simple mathematical calculation that provides an estimate of body fat and
    can be used to determin whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight,
    obese.
                      
             The formula for calculating BMI is;
                      
             BMI = weight (kg) / height(m)*height(m).
             Here's a breakdown of the BMI categories:
                       
                ~ Underweight: BMI less than 18.5.
                ~ Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9.
                ~ Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9.
                ~ Obese: BMI 30 or higher.
                       
    It typically involves a person's weight and height calculation automatically.
    It generates the corresponding BMI valueand provides an interpretation of the
    results based on the established categories.
                      
             Limitations:
                         It doesn't take into account factors such as muscle mass,
                         bone density, or overall body composition.
                                  
                         It doesn't provide information about the distribution of body fat,
                         which can be relevant for assessing health risks associated with 
                         obesity.
        
    The BMI serves as a quick and straightforward method for estimating body weight
    status.
    
    
### Rock, Paper and Scissors.

     This is a simple program that allows the player to enter their choice (Rock, Paper, Scissors) and 
     play against the computer, which randomly selects its choice.
     
     A function compares the choices and determines the winner based on the game rules.
     
     Its run on a Python environment, and it wil keep prompting you for your choice until you type
     'quit' to exit. After each round, it displays the computer's choice and the result.
     
     It can be customized to add more features.

### Text to Speech

    Convert Text to Speech in Python

    The user enters text and the app turns it into audio with a click

    Libraries :
    
    * tkinter
    * gTTS
    * playsound

    Steps :

    Initialize tkinter windoww and configure the window.

    Add widgets to the window = labels, entry boxes and buttons on the screen.

    Function for the three buttons :
        
        Exit button = destroy the window

        Reset button = deletes the content and setting it blank (str)

        Convert button = convert text to voice


    Definition

    get : to get the text entered and store in a variable,

    gTTS : to convert the message to speech,

    save : to save the speech in mp3 format,

    playsound : to play the speech saved.
