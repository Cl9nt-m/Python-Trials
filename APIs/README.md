## Python APIs

#### What is an API?.

**Application Programing Interface**, is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software aaplications or systems to communicate and interact wih each other.

It defines the methods and dat formats that applications can use to request and exchange information or perform specific functions. They enable developers to access functionality of other software components, services, or platforms, often abstracting the underlying complexities and providing a standardized way to interact with them.

They are essential for building software applications that can leverage the capabilities of other services, access data from remote sources, or integrate with various third-party systems, making them a fundamental building block in modern software development.
