# Hello, Welcome to my space showcasing my personnal python-trials
I have used simple, medium and complex programs to sharpen my 
Python knowledge both in theory and practically.

I have a have .py programs categorized based on environment of study.

1. school.py
            Though pip I have installed and used different packages.
            Dependancies to install :
                                
                                 ~ os
                                 ~ random
                                 ~ pyqrcode
                                 ~ argparse
                                 ~ time
                                 ~ dns.revolver
                                 ~ json
                                 ~ socket
            
            Do you know Menu Driven Program?.

            It's a type of computer pogram which accepts the input from the user by showing a list of options and users have to select ant of the options to perform any operation.

            I've used functions to illustrate Menu Driven Program, After executing. The compiler will display the list of menu options. The user has to choose the option and enter it.
            The compiler will compare the input entered by the user and then call the function.

            Choose 10 to Quit.
