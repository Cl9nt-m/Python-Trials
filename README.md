### Do you know Menu Driven Program?.

    It's a type of computer pogram which accepts the input from the user by showing a list of options and users 
    have to select ant of the options to perform any operation.

    I've used functions to illustrate Menu Driven Program, After executing. The compiler will display the list 
    of menu options. The user has to choose the option and enter it.
    
    I have created programs linked together in a Menu Driven Program. The programs are:
    
       ~ Project-1:
                    This are small projects designed for a beginner in python projects.

       ~ Project-2:
                    This are advanced projects focused on computer networks.
